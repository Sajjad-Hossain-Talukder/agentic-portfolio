I am Sajjad, a Software Engineer currently working with Pivotly, a US-based MNC, where I focus on developing mobile applications. Alongside mobile development, I am fluent in backend technologies such as Go and Node.js (Express.js) and frontend development with React. I also work with iOS (Swift) and React Native for cross-platform solutions. My interests extend deeply into Agentic AI systems and Named Data Networking (NDN), where I am actively learning and exploring applications. I have experience participating in problem-solving contests and contributing to diverse projects, including GenAI-based image and video generation, with a strong focus on agentic systems.
